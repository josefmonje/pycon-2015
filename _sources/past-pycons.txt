Past PyCons
===========

2014
----

PyCon PH 2014 was held at De La Salle University on February 22-23. It was the
second Philippines PyCon and the first PyCon hosted after the incorporation of
Python.PH. PyCon 2014 was a huge success with attendees from around the
Philippines, as well as foreign guests.

During PyCon 2014, we paid respect to Malcolm Tredinnick, a PyCon 2012 speaker,
who unexpectedly passed away and left a hole in the International Python
Community. Our keynote speaker, Russell Keith-Magee from the Django
Software Foundation, shared stories about Malcolm's accomplishments.

2012
----

The first Python Conference in the Philippines was held last June 30 to July 1
2012 in UP Diliman. Spearheaded by Frank and Ann Pohlmann of Auberon Solutions,
it was a huge success in spite of a short amount of time we had for the
preparation. The conference was graced upon representatives from the Python
Software Foundation (PSF) and a turnout of roughly 240 students and
professionals across the country. It was truly an inspiring event with a
diverse audience and a distinct spirit of volunteerism that made it happen.
